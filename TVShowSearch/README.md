# TV Show Search

The purpose of this site was to practice DOM manipulation and using an API. In this case, the TVMaze API was used. 

## Functionality 

The user is able to search for any key word(s) of their choice, and results containing the key word(s) will be displayed. 

The show information that the user will see is: 
1. Title
2. Type 
3. Summary

Each time the user makes a search, the previous result is cleared, and the new results are displayed.
