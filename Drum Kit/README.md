# Drum Kit

The purpose of creating this site was to practice DOM manipulation. 

## Functionality 

This site allows a user to hear all the different sounds that different drums make (i.e. crash, kick, snare). 

To hear the sound of the drum, the user can either click on the button, or key down on the corresponding letter that is attached to the drum. 
The user input is not case sensitive (i.e. The user gets the same response if they press "a" or "A"). 

However the user chooses to interact with the buttons, they will recieve an indication that the button has been pressed. 

**Please find below what the user will see when they visit the site:**
